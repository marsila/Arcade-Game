# Arcade game project by Rasha Ali

This is my version of the Arcade Game. It is part of the front-end web developer Nano-degree program.
The canvas functions code was provided by Udacity.

## About the game

In this game the player will try to reach the other side of the board(the water),
without hitting the bugs (enemies) and thus win the game.
The player has three tries, and he/she can increase his chances with each gem he collects. The maximum number of gems is three.
When a collisione happens between the player and a bug, the player loses a star and return to the start position but if he had hearts he will lose the hearts first.
When the player loses all his hearts and stars he will lose and the game will be over.
When the player wins, his score will be the remaining stars.
If the player loses one or 2 stars in the beginning of the game and then he collects all the 3 gems without losing any of them 
till the end of game, he will win an additional star to be added to his score.
